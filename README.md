# NTCC-Indian-Sign-Language
This project involves using the MediaPipe library from Google to detect various hand gestures of the Indian Sign Language. The project can be altered with minimal effort to use live video from camera, pictures, and pre recorded videos. Intuitive keys have been used to demonstrate certain functions of the library.
